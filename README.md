The National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1955â€“56 season to the best performing player of the regular season. The winner receives the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, which is named in honor of the first commissioner (then president) of the NBA, who served from 1946 until 1963.

To do this, a complete machine learning pipeline will be built with the following steps:  collection of data on NBA players from 1998 to the last Season from the current site https://www.basketball-reference.com/ using the Web crawling data, then: - cleaning data , data preparation, - research data about NBA teams and players - data preprocessing, feature engineering - testing predictive machine learning model - modeling predictive machine learning model
